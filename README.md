# 15_Puzzle_Multiple_Search_Algorithms

## Introduction:

The 15-Puzzle (or N-Puzzle, Gem_puzzle, Game of Fifteen, Mytic Square, etc.) is a sliding puzzle that consists of a square (sqrt(N+1) x sqrt(N+1)) frame with numbers labeled 1-N in random order leaving 1 empty slot with no label/number. The goal is to slide the numbers so that they are in order of 1, 2, 3, ..., N.

*Note:* 0 here represents the 'empty slot'

*Example: A 15-Puzzle (4x4 Board)*

The following program solves the the N-Puzzle Board Game problem using multiple search techniques. </br>
The following searches were used: BFS, DFS, IDDFS, A-Star. </br>
Once the program has finished executing, the memory and time complexity is printed for each search for comparison. </br>
__A-Star with the Manhattan Heuristic produced the best results.__ </br>
Each __search__-file depends on constants.py, globals.py, board.py, main.py. </br> 
The program was created using Python 3.6 </br>

## Files:
*__Note: A Hashmap is used for all the search algorithms to avoid visiting already visited states.__*

__a_star.py:__ A standalone file that uses the A-Star Search Algorithm. The heuristics used for the algorithm are Manhattan Distance and Number of Displaced Tiles.

__bfs.py:__ A standalone file that uses the Breadth First Search Algorithm using a Min-Priority Queue

__board.py:__ A Board Class that essentially holds the contents of the board.

__constants.py:__ A constants file that holds all the constants that is used throughout the program. The program was designed to complete a 15-Puzzle, but with slight modification, it can solve any size puzzle (if given enough memory)

__globals.py:__ A globals file essentially to hold the global variables for memory usage and comparisons.

__iddfs.py:__ Iterative Deepening Depth First Search file that attempts to find the goal state using IDDFS both iteratively and recurisvely.

__main.py:__ The main driver of the program. (Simple terminal GUI to prompt user for a board or to randomize it).

__node.py:__ A node class that holds the current board, the parent board (where it came from), the heuristic value of the board, and the total cost to get to that board.

## Limitations:
If a "difficult" board is passed in, none of these search algorithms will work. They will timeout after 15 seconds due to using up all the memory.
The solution to this would be to use A-Star and create subsets of the Puzzle Board and break up the board into smaller components to have "smaller" goal states. This will fix this memory usage issue/limitations. As of right now, the A-Star Manhattan Heuristic program used for this project can complete 99% of all board states. The fix can be easily be achievable once I have more time to work on it :)

## TODOs:
* Handle the case explained in the limitations. </br>
* Use a mathematical technique of inversions to determine *immediately* if a board is solvable or not. </br>
